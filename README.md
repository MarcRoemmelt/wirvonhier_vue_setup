# A personal Playground - Client
================================

This repository houses to client of my playground app. I might or might not add modules with new ideas or just really anything I want to play with.
In rare instances there might even be an article refering to this repository or rather one feature it contains.

## A (mock) enterprise Vue app
This app is built with Vue and best practices of large-scale enterprise apps in mind.
(If I don't get tired of it) You will encounter TDD, TypeScript and a high degree of modularity - or my attempts to make these principles more feasable in a project maintained by a single developer.

Everyone is welcome to use, replicate, and modify it in any way they see fit.
